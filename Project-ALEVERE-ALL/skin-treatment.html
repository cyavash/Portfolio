									At Alevere we can offer you anti-ageing skincare that has been scientifically proved to work. This is because it contains active ingredients at strengths not available on the high street.
								</p>
								<p>
									So our advice to you is not to spend money on expensive cosmetic brands. You could use them for years and not see an improvement.
								</p>
								<p>

									although you have probably been convinced otherwise by campaigns for those big  brands, you do not actually need many products to slow down changes and reverse damage that has already been done.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here is a quick summary of what you need, after cleansing your skin with whatever product you prefer. The products listed here will have a dramatic effect on your skin.

								<h5>An anti-oxidant serum</h5>
								<p>
									We recommend Skinceuticals Phloretin CF Serum because it is the most potent available.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is what it will do for your skin: protect against damage and ageing caused by chemical reactions;  protect against sun damage;  help correct existing damage by speeding up collagen production, the substance that gives your skin youthful bounce and support; speed up cell renewal; soften and moisturise; improve fine lines, wrinkles and  texture.

								</p>

									If your skin is especially dry or sensitive we have other options.

								<p>
									Moisturiser is not as important to your skincare  as you probably think. 
								</p>
								<p>
									It cannot make any permanent improvement and it cannot actually add moisture to you skin, because your skin is waterproof, but it can slow down the rate of water loss and make you look temporarily plumped-up.
								</p>
								<p>
									On the days you need it, we recommend two options by Skinceuticals. One is lightweight, the other is richer. You will not need a special eye cream.

								<p>
									This is the gold standard for anti-ageing skincare and independent studies in leading medical journals show beyond any doubt that it has a profound anti-ageing effect. 
								</p>
								<p>
									It can only be prescribed under the supervision of one of our doctors and needs to be applied on its own - don't add moisturizer or anything else because you will simply dilute its effect.
								</p>
								<p>
									Tretinoin (you might know its a former brand name, Retin A) stimulates collagen production, increases the production of hyaluronic acid which is the skins own natural and powerful moisturiser, causes exfoliation so the skin is lightened and brightened, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and reduces cell abnormalities so is likely to reduce the risk of skin cancer.
								</p>
								<p>
									It can have some side effects - irritation redness and flaking - so we advise everyone to gradually build up their use.

									At Alevere we can offer you anti-ageing skincare that has been scientifically proved to work. This is because it contains active ingredients at strengths not available on the high street.
								</p>
								<p>
									So our advice to you is not to spend money on expensive cosmetic brands. You could use them for years and not see an improvement.
								</p>
								<p>
									But we can make a genuine difference to your skin - and we can also simplify your skincare routine because,

									although you have probably been convinced otherwise by campaigns for those big  brands, you do not actually need many products to slow down changes and reverse damage that has already been done.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here is a quick summary of what you need, after cleansing your skin with whatever product you prefer. The products listed here will have a dramatic effect on your skin.
								</p>

								<h4 class="rounded-heading">In The Morning</h4>
								<img class="pull-right s-img1" src="img/s-img1.jpg" alt="Anti oxidant serum" />
								<h5>An anti-oxidant serum</h5>
								<p>
									We recommend Skinceuticals Phloretin CF Serum because it is the most potent available.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is what it will do for your skin: protect against damage and ageing caused by chemical reactions;  protect against sun damage;  help correct existing damage by speeding up collagen production, the substance that gives your skin youthful bounce and support; speed up cell renewal; soften and moisturise; improve fine lines, wrinkles and  texture.

								</p>
								<p>
									If your skin is especially dry or sensitive we have other options.

								<h4 class="rounded-heading">A Sunscreen</h4>
								<img class="pull-left s-img2" src="img/s-img2.jpg" alt="Sunscreen Image" />
								<p>
									We recommend Skinceuticals Facial Sunscreen because it is the  most effective at protecting you from UVA rays, as well as UVB.

								<h4 class="rounded-heading">A moisuriser as and when necessary</h4>
								<img class="pull-right s-img3" src="img/s-img3.jpg" alt="moisturizer image" />
								<p>
									Moisturiser is not as important to your skincare  as you probably think. 
								</p>
								<p>
									It cannot make any permanent improvement and it cannot actually add moisture to you skin, because your skin is waterproof, but it can slow down the rate of water loss and make you look temporarily plumped-up.
								</p>
								<p>
									On the days you need it, we recommend two options by Skinceuticals. One is lightweight, the other is richer. You will not need a special eye cream.

								<h4 class="rounded-heading">Night</h4>
								<img src="img/s-img4.jpg" class="pull-left s-img4" alt="Tretinoin Cream" />
								<h5>Tretenoin Cream</h5>
								<p>
									This is the gold standard for anti-ageing skincare and independent studies in leading medical journals show beyond any doubt that it has a profound anti-ageing effect. 
								</p>
								<p>
									It can only be prescribed under the supervision of one of our doctors and needs to be applied on its own - don't add moisturizer or anything else because you will simply dilute its effect.
								</p>
								<p>
									Tretinoin (you might know its a former brand name, Retin A) stimulates collagen production, increases the production of hyaluronic acid which is the skins own natural and powerful moisturiser, causes exfoliation so the skin is lightened and brightened, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and reduces cell abnormalities so is likely to reduce the risk of skin cancer.
								</p>
								<p>
									It can have some side effects - irritation redness and flaking - so we advise everyone to gradually build up their use.
								</p>
								<p>
									But if you find your skin cannot tolerate Tretinoin, which is available in two strengths, we have other options for you.<a href="#"> Read more here</a>
