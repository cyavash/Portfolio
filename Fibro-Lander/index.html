		<div class="review-content">
			<p><strong>My name is Cindy Sparling</strong>
			, and I'm the president of Fibromyalgia Treatment Group. We specialize exclusively in the research of natural ways to
			reduce symptoms related to fibromyalgia.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, we don't offer any products that aren't related to helping those with fibromyalgia. If you too suffer from this
				disease, you'll want to hear how <strong>I overcame my symptoms of fibromyalgia</strong> after 4 years of suffering.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am 52 years old and married with four children, all grown now. I have suffered from migraine headaches for my entire adult life.
				<strong>My husband founded a natural formulation</strong> that substantially helped my migraines, and that's when I found out how powerful
				natural supplementation can be to relieving ailments. It was then that I set my goal to figure out a way to relieve my painful fibromyalgia 
				symptoms. It became the most important project in my life.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="rc2">
			<h3>My Diagnosis</h3>
			<p>
				It all started five years ago when I was involved in a serious rear-end car accident. I was hospitalized, and my recovery took much longer than was
				expected. I started experiencing serious pain and inflammation which seemed to move throughout my body. I had been experiencing tender spots all over my body,
				especially my back. I had trouble sleeping.
			</p>
			<p>
				My energy went away and I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. The worst thing that happened was a complete loss of my mental clarity. I seemed to always
				be in a fog. I went into a serious depression for several years.
			</p>
			<p>
				I averaged 15 doctor visits every year for the first couple of years, and was hospitalized several times. Some of these doctors even considered me a hypochondriac and
				discredited many of my symptoms. Years of taking pain medications and antidepressants only seemed to  make my condition worse. I was eventually diagnosed with fibromyalgia after
				being referred to many "experts" and undergoing numberous tests.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong class="big-bold">"You'll just have to learn to live with it" was my doctor's diagnosis.</strong>
			All he could do for me was prescribe pain medications and antidepressants, which I stayed on for years.</p>
			<p>
				What's more, I hated how the pain killers made me feel , but If I wanted to function I had no choice but to stay on them. Even worse, I lived with it for 4 more years as the disease
				progressed to a point where I finally became desperate.
			</p>
			<p><strong class="big-bold">I turned to the internet and found that there were alternatives.</strong></p>
			<p>
				My husband had hired several researchers to help him develop his migraine product, and recruited their services to help me find or develop an effective
				formulation to relieve my fibromyalgia.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, we researched all the options the medical community had been using for fibromyalgia. Dozens of interviews revealed that most doctors had very limited success with the available options
				they offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				We conducted extensive research on all the products that were on the market: prescription, over the counter, and natural supplementation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through this process, we concluded that natural supplementation would be the best approach, offering the highest likelihood of success with the least amount of side effects.
				Options included vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts.
			</p>
			<p>
				We discovered that some people were finding relief from various supplements, which included: SAMe, Vitamin D, Ribose, Magnesium, B-complex vitamins, Alpha Lipoic Acid, 5-HTP, Melatonin, 
				Turmeric, Boswellia, and a variety of other natural supplements and plant extracts.
			</p>
			<p>
				We looked at the natural products which were already available and soon discovered that none offered a complete formulation. A combination of many ingredients were known to help sufferers, but in order
				to maintain that combo one would have to buy an entire stockpile of supplements.
			</p>
			
			<h3>The problem with Fibromyalgia</h3>
			<p>
				The problem was that the disease has five basic areas that needed to be addressed. The symptoms that are most prevalent are pain and inflammation, energy, mental clarity, sleep disorders and general biological functions
				of the body.
			</p>
			<p>
				It became clear that the best way to attack my condition with natural supplementation was to develop our own formulation that accounted for all the symptoms, with proven clinical results.
			</p>
			<p>
				My team and I hit the books, diving into every clinical trial conducted throughout the years from all around the world. We tapped into the clinical studies and trials of universities, research scientists, rheumatologists and other
				specialty doctors. The research they provided helped us discover the most powerful natural ingredients available for aiding in the relief of all the areas of fibromyalgia symptoms, with minimal to no side effects.
			</p>
			
			<h3>A product is born</h3>
			<p>
				After over a year of research, interviews, and scientific experimentation, we finally developed a correct formulation of ingredients and found their most bioavailable forms. Through research, analysis and trial and error, we established the 
				most effective serving amounts, all backed by solid clinical studies.
			</p>
			<p>
				As soon as we knew we had developed the perfect blend, I began taking the formulation myself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within a few short weeks my symptoms diminsed considerably. We began sharing the formulatoin with other fibromyalgia acquaintances and they started experiencing the same amazing results!
			</p>
			<p>
				We soon realized how powerful this formulation could be for helping people who suffer from fibromyalgia, and named the blend <strong>Fibrolief</strong>.

		<div class="features">
			<h4 class="heading-bg">Pain and Inflammation</h4>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features1.jpg" alt="Turmeric and Curcumin" />
				<h5>Turmeric/Curcumin</h5>
				<p>Turmeric has bee used medicinally for over 2500 years!</p>
				<p>Curcumin is a potent anti-oxidant with insanely powerful anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties.
				This marvel of nature has virtually no side-effects and offers vast benefits to fibromyalgia sufferers.</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, curcumin has long been known to have poor bioavailability, meaning the rate at which it is absorbed
					is minimal. However, we also include BioPerine(C) in our formula which has been shown to increase the effectiveness
					by 2000%.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features2.jpg" alt="Boswellia AKBA" class="fi2" />
				<h5>Boswellia AKBA (ApresFlex(C))</h5>
				<p>
					Boswellia is a popular herb used for its benefits in fighting inflammation. Its anti-inflammatory effects involve many processes that the body
					uses to help heal itself, and could correlate to benefiting many chronic illnesses, such as arthritis an fibromyalgia.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has a long history of use, particularly in India, where it is used in combination with curcumin to relieve arthritis pain. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross
					over stuy concluded that the care of osteoarthritis with this herbomineral formulation reduced the painful symptoms (Kulkarni, RR, 1991).
				</p>
				<p>
					Boswellia Serrata extract providing Acetyl-11-keto-&beta;-boswellic acid (AKBA) has been shown to increase joint mobility an ease stiff joints. We only use Apresflex(C) which offers
					highly concentrated levels of AKBA not found in most supplements.
				</p>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features3.jpg" alt="White Willow Bark" />
				<h5>White Willow Bark Extract</h5>
				<p>
					White Willow Bark extract contains the active ingredient salicin which is a Cox-1 and Cox-2 inhibitor, an acts as an anti-inflammatory and also reduces pain 
					by inhibiting prostaglandins. Animal experimentation at Cairo University compared willow bark extract to ASA (aspirin), and found that willow bark was equally
					or more effective as aspirin reducing inflammation; even thuogh the salicin content was lower than an equivalent dose of ASA. It is recommended to take white willow
					bark instead of aspirin because it is less irritating to the stomach lining.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features4.jpg" alt="Celery Seed Extract" class="fi2" />
				<h5>Celery Seed Extract</h5>
				<p>
					Celery seed extract has been used as a pain reliever for arthritis, fibromyalgia and gout. It is known to help reduce muscle spasms
					and to alleviate painful gas an bloating. It is also known to aid in improving the painful symptoms of fibromyalgia sufferers by reducing
					inflammation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Celery seed contains a number of biologically beneficial substance, including flavanoids high in antioxidants, coumarin with anti-coagulating effects,
					violatile oils ,omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid, and the powerful healing compound 3-n-butylphthlaide (3-n-B). 3-n-B is extremely effective at reducing
					the action of the COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX pain triggers. In one study of patients with long-term joint discomfort, celery seed helped reduce tenderness and improve
					flexibility in a remarkable 68% of patients.
				</p>		
			</div>
			
			<h4 class="heading-bg increased-E">Increased Energy</h4>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features5.jpg" alt="Malic Acid and Malate" />
				<h5>Malic Acid/Malate</h5>
				<p>
					Malic acid works with magnesium in the production of ATP, our body's source for energy. In a stuy published in 1992 in the "Journal of Nutritional Medicine," magnesium
					and malic acid are important for ATP production; the authors further postulate that fibromyalgia symptoms are mostly caused by a deficiency in magnesium and malate, also 
					known as malic acid.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features6.jpg" alt="Acetyl L Carnitine" />
				<h5>Acetyl-L-Carnitine</h5>
				<p>
					Acetyl-L-Carnitine is an amino acid and one of several forms of carnitines at work in your body. Carnitines carry certain fatty foods
					to mitochondria to be burned as fuels, as well as carrying away the processes' resulting waste products. These carnitine amino acids are protein
					building blocks that help the body produce energy.
				</p>
				<p>
					All carnitines are antioxidants, and this particular amino acid has been shown to improve endurance and relieve the fatigure associated with fibromyalgia and celiac disease.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features7.jpg" alt="Rhodiola Rosea" />
				<h5>Rhodiola Rosea</h5>
				<p>
					This herb is considered an adaptogen, which is a class of herbs said to help build resistance to stress. In herbal medicine, rhodiola is typically used for fatigue, depression, sleep problems,
					poor attention span and poor memory.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a 4 week stuy with 82 participants, rhodiola extracts was able to greatly reduced dysfunction and fatigure associated with stress. Significany improvements were noted in social and work function
					secondary to reduced fatigue and improved mood.
				</p>	
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features8.jpg" alt="Coenzyme Q10" class="fi8" />
				<h5>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) A powerful Antioxidant</h5>
				<p>
					CoQ10 is a vitamin-like substance that is found naturally in the body. Our bodies' natural production of CoQ10 steadily declines as our
					age increases, and this deficiency can be compensated with natural CoQ10 supplements.
				</p>
				<p>
					A recent study by the University of Maryland found that CoQ10 could help reduce damage to the brain caused by stroke, improve energy levels, and increase the body's tolerance
					to and recovery from exercise.
				</p>
				<p>
					CoQ10 promotes energy production in the body in the form of ATP. Ninety-five percentof the human body's energy is generated this way. CoQ10 helps convert food into energy and aids
					in metabolism.
				</p>
				<p>
					Three different studies have found that using 100mg of CoQ10 a day produces statistically significant results, especially in combination with a daily supplement of magnesium citrate 
					and riboflavin.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4 class="heading-bg heading-bg2 mental-C">Mental Clarity Ingredients:</h4>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features9.jpg" alt="bacopa monnieri" />
				<h5>Bacopa Monniery</h5>
				<p>
					Bacopa is a herb long used for memory enhancement, concentration and mental alertness. Several studies indicate
					that bacopa may help preserve memory and enhance cognitive function.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a 2008 study of older adults, researchers found that 12 weeks of supplementation with bacopa led to significany improvements
					in memory, depression, anxiety, and heart rate. In a 2001 stuy of healthy adults, participants showed significant improvements in memory,
					learning and anxiety.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features10.jpg" alt="SAM-e image" class="fi10" />
				<h5>SAM-e</h5>
				<p>
					SAM-e is made from amino acid methionine and ATP. Studies have shown its effective for arthritis pain and shows both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Europe has had SAM-e available by prescription for many years as an antidepressant, and it has been available over-the-counter in the US since 1996. Dr. Ascanio Polimeni,
					a renowned physician in Rome, Italy, stated that "... doctors in Europe prescribe SAM-e for the therapy of many conditions, including depression, chronic fatigue syndrome,
					and fibromyalgia."
				</p>
				<p>
					The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service commissioned a three-year survey of studies conducted on SAMe. The published report concluded that it is effective for depression
					and osteoarthritis, without the harmful side effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					A deficiency in vitamins B12 or folic acid may reduce levels of SAMe in your body, it works best to take all three supplements together or combined.
				</p>
				<p>
					The University of Maryland Medical Center states, "SAMe can be effective in reducing symptoms of fibromyalgia - including pain, fatigue, morning stiffness, and depressed mood."
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4 class="heading-bg biological-F">Biological Function:</h4>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img class="fi2" src="img/features11.jpg" alt="Vegetables are rich of magnesium" />
				<h5>Magnesium</h5>
				<p>
					It is estimated that 60%-80% of Americans are deficient in magnesium. This critical mineral is responsible for over 300 enzyme reactions and is found 
					in all of your tissues - but magnesium is mainly prominent and mot important in your muscles, bones, and brain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Magnesium can be an effective way to combat stress and studies show it improves your sleep. Your cells need magnesium to produce energy. It is necessary for 
					many different chemical pumps to work, to stabilize membranes, and to help muscles relax.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many people can be sensitive to variou form of Magnesium when they are supplied in high quantities. To counteract any gastrointestinal complications, we use a blend
					of 5 different forms of magnesium to provide maximum absorption.
				</p>
			
			</div>
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features12.jpg" alt="SAM-e" class="fi10" />
				<h5>SAM-e</h5>
				<p>
					SAM-e is made from amino acid methionine and ATP. Studies have shown it is effective for arthritis pain and shows both
					analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Europe has had SAM-e available by prescription for many years as an antidepressant, and it has been available over-the-counter

					The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a three-year survey of studies conducted on SAMe. The published report concluded
					that it is effective for depression and osteoarthritis, without the harmful side effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					A deficiency in vitamins B12 or folic acid may reduce levels of SAMe in your body, it works best to take all three supplements together or combined.	
				</p>
				<p>
					The University of Maryland Medical Center states, "SAMe can be effective in reducing symptoms of fibromyalgia - including pain, fatigue, mmorning stiffness, and 
					depressed mood."
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features13.jpg" alt="Vitamin D3" />
				<h5>Vitamin D3</h5>
				<p>
					Vitamin D3 is crucial for the absorption and metabolism of calcium and phosphorous, which both maintain and strengthen bones and teeth and prevent
					bone loss and bone disorders. It is an essential ingredient in reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
				</p>
				<p>
					D3 also protects against muscle weakness and immune system issues. It has been shown to reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis in women.
				</p>
				<p>
					Greg Plotnikoff, MD, senior consultant with the Allina Center for Health Care Innovations in Minnesota published a study in 2003 on 150 people who came to a health clinic
					complaining of chronic pain. Virtually all of them - 93% - had extremely low vitamin D levels.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features14.jpg" alt="Folic Acid" class="fi2" />
				<h5>Benfotiamine (B1) | Methylcobalamine (B12) | Folic Acid</h5>
				<p>
					Fibrolief is loaded with the most bioavailable forms of B vitamins. Some studies have found low levels of vitamin B1 and reduced
					activity of some thiamine-dependent enzymes among people with fibromyalgia.<br />
					B12 deficiency is usually reported with symptoms of fatigue. Vitamin B12 is essential in converting carbs into glucose in the body.
					Sufficient B12 levels are linked to an increase in energy production and a decrease in fatigue and lethargy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Folic acid is believed to play a part in mood regulation. These B vitamins also help increase the level of SAMe in your body.
				</p>
				<p>
					We only use the most bioavailable forms of these ingredients and not the cheaper and more common cyanocobalamin (B12) and thiamine (B1).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features15.jpg" alt="Lipoic Acid" class="fi2" />
				<h5>Stabilized R-Alpha Lipoic Acid</h5>
				<p>
					R-ALA is a potent antioxidant that is both fat and water soluble, which improves the function of cell "transporters" that carry and distribute glucose.
					It is one of the few substances that can cross the blood/brain barrier and pass easily into the brain to go directly where it is needed most.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most importantly, R-ALA is only antioxidant that has the unique ability to self-regenerate and to also regenerate many other antioxiants, such as B vitamins.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many studies, doctors, and researches have shown stabilized R-ALA to be up to 12 times more effective than the cheaper S-ALA found in most ALA supplements. B vitamins
					and R-ALA are absolutely essential ingredients in helping to reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia and ease nerve pain.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features16.jpg" alt="Zinc" />
				<h5>Zinc</h5>
				<p>
					Zinc is a mineral that has immune boosting properties and is a powerful antioxidant. Zinc is so important because it is found in every
					tissue in the body and is directly involved in cell division and studies have shown that low zinc is common in over half of the US population
				</p>
				<p>
					According to a 2010 study published by the "European Journal of Clinical Nutrition," zinc supplementation may improve mood in women, and may even be effective
					for depression.
				</p>
				<p>
					Adequate zinc levels are essential for keeping your immune system strong if you suffer from fibromyalgia.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="features-box">
				<img src="img/features17.jpg" alt="Black Pepper Bioperine" />
				<h5>Black Pepper Bioperine</h5>
				<p>
					Bioperine is an extract derived from black pepper and is found to be bioavailability enhancer of a variety of nutrients.
					It also has immune-suppressing, tumor-inhibiting, and antidepressant effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to an article published in the Journal of Ayruveda and Integrative Medicine in 2010, piperine has been shown to 
					increase the absorption of vitamin C, selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin B-6, and coenzyme Q.

			<p>
				I have been quite distressed with all the body pains and constant fatigue. After working my way through
				5 doctors at a major hospital in Reno, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Many of the medications did not help.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully, I tried Fibrolief. This has been a major factor in dramatically decreasing the pain that I had. My energy has
				returned and I am again doing the things I love. I am beginning to enjoy my active life again.

			<p>
				I have suffered with fibromyalgia for nearly four years. I was first diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, but after the pain and other symptoms
				persisted, my doctor finally got the diagnosis right. Everyone around me thought I was some kind of hypochondriac. I was just always sick and tired.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pain finally started to ease off after taking your product for about six weeks. I will continue using this as it is the first time in three years that I have
				felt so hopeful. Thank you for helping me.

			<h5>"It worked for me"</h5>
			<p>
				I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in March of 2010. At that time I was suffering from severe pain and had no energy. I could not get a good night's sleep.
				I fell into depression which lasted a few years. My doctor prescribed me pain meds and anti-depressants, but they never really helped my condition.
			</p>
			<p>
				So I looked around on the internet and came across Fibrolief which was a vitamin formula and I wondered what a vitamin can really do. I signed up for the 2 week trial
				and I did not notice anything durint that time. My doctor said It could take up to three or four months for some vitamins to take effect, so I kept taking them. I did start to 
				notice a difference in about 2 months.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				So I would definitely advise anyone with fibromyalgia to give Fibrolief a chance.

		<h4 class="big-reasons"><span>3</span> Biggest Reasons Why Many Supplements Don't Work...</h4>
		
		<div class="reason-box reason-box1">
			<h5><span>1.</span></h5>
			<p>
				<strong>A product with only one or two nutrients can't do it all.</strong>
				You can't expect a single nutrient to address the various symptoms associated with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia
				affects the whole body from neutral function to the gastrointestinal tract. It takes a synergistic approach with a variety
				of targeted nutrients to have any kind of lasting impact.
			</p>	
		</div>
		<div class="reason-box">
			<h5><span>2.</span></h5>
			<p>
				<strong>"Kitchen sink" formulas with low quantities.</strong>
				Some products try to impress with a laundry list of ingredients but when you really take a look, the 
				dosages are so low that they will never have an elicit response.
			</p>	
		</div>
		<div class="reason-box">
			<h5><span>3.</span></h5>
			<p>
				<strong>Using low quality ingredients.</strong>
				Most people don't know this, but there are dozens of forms and potencies of nearly each and every vitamin
				and mineral on the market. Most products are looking to minimize ingredient costs even if it means using sub par suppliers
				and poorly absorbed forms of nutrients.
