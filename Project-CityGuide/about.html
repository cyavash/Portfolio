				<p>
					Anyone who has ever had this thought cross their mind: 
					"What if I just buy a ticket and go on an adventure?"
				</p>
				<p>
					TravelCats crave adventure, excitement, and culture. They love to try new restaurants, seek out the chicest speakeasy, 
					catch a late night burlesque show and find the hole in the wall antique store full of treasures. 
				</p>
				<p>
					TravelCats are trendy, savvy travelers. People who will go with an itinerary but also leave room for roaming aimlessly,
					only to stumble upon our new favorite bakery.
