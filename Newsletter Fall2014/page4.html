			Myron is a Philadelphia native whose background in acting and producing has allowed him to establish an excellent pool of talent, many of which can be 
			seen in some of the most popular films and television in the past five years. 
			He loves helping young talent to get their legs and succeed in the industry.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The world is growing smaller each day and this is reflected in the entertainment industry and in casting, for that matter. Victor Kruglov & Associates has been
			dedicated to the success of talent from various cultures and have been getting them seen by casting directors and producers for nearly 30 years.
		</p>
		<p>	
			It is greatly apparent today that technology has allowed casting to reach far beyond local boundaries. With the rise of Internet casting, industry professionals can reach 
			and hire talent globally for their projects and casting is now able to stretch its net far and wide and acquire the best possible bookings for its productions. Technology also
			affords actors the ability to pursue a career from their own backyard wherever that may be. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Every day, we are inundated with requests from talent from all over the globe imploring us 
			to represent their interests in Hollywood. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="p4p2">
			Today's fast paced world filled with instant gratification allows almost anyone with a smartphone to tape an audition and send it across the globe in near real-time. Due to advancements in such technology, 
			casting has dramatically changed its course. In just the past few years, we have seen more independently produced projects, who utilize video feeds to conduct their casting, rather than the traditional in-person
			method. At the very least, casting uses these technologies to view a greater quantity of talent than they previously could and these pre-taped video submissions help them to obtain a first impression prior to 
			presenting talent to producers and this, in term, saves time and money.
		</p>
		<p>
			As you might have already noticed, technological advancements allow improved casting and better talent searches. Actors are sought out via the Internet and uploaded videos are viewed daily from popular casting sites.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			As a result, today's actor will need greater technological and artistic knowledge than ever before. They will need to be able to play producer, director and actor, as the modern entertainment landscape requires such expertise.
			If talent can produce and direct auditions for such casting protocols as “Eco-Cast” with better quality than their counterparts, their future may be bright. If not, no matter how great a performer's talent, they will be left behind in the proverbial dust.
